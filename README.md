I am a Computer Engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience in Data Analysis, particularly within the Aviation Industry, and 10 years of service in the Colombian Aerospace Force. I am passionate about technology, business intelligence, and data-driven decision-making, with a solid foundation in data visualization, relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), and Microsoft Excel.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in Python and SQL, and I have also gained expertise in machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, as well as NoSQL databases. I am dedicated to continuous learning and have pursued courses in Big Data, Data Science, Microsoft Azure, and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am advancing my knowledge by studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Lasalle College in Montreal, while simultaneously pursuing a Master's Degree in Big Data at IMF Smart Education. Additionally, I am developing my French language skills and expanding my business intelligence expertise, preparing myself for a career as a Data Scientist.
